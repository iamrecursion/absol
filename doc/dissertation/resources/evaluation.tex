\chapter{Evaluation} % (fold)
\label{cha:evaluation}
This section will include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An examination of how the system meets it high-level goals.
    \item Identification and discussion of areas requiring improvement, alteration and further work.
    \item Concluding with discussion of the major successes and failures of the ABSOL system.
\end{itemize}

% Flaws of the metalanguage:
%   - No direct use of environment accesses in basic semantics, requiring indirection.
%   - Fairly awkward use of the environment (no ability to delete properties, for example). 
%   - Grammar admits some nonsensical terms such as alternations with semantics not at the top-level. These are ignored by the metacompiler, but are inelegant. Ideally this would not be allowed by the grammar at all.
