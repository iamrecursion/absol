\chapter{Architecture and Algorithms} % (fold)
\label{cha:architecture_and_algorithms}
% This section will contain:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Architectural Overview:} An overview of the system architecture, linked to the high-level requirements.
%     This will touch on the portions of the system that were ruled out of scope later on, and why.
%     \item \textbf{System Component Examination:} An examination of the design of each of the system components in detail.
%     \item \textbf{The Development of Metaspec:} The process of developing the metaspec language itself, as well as some syntax examples and full syntax description. 
%     \item \textbf{Algorithmic Descriptions:} The verification engine in particular is very heavy on algorithmic work. 
%     These algorithms will be explained here, accompanied by any additional proof work that they require. 
%     This will include proofs for the special form semantics.
%     It will also look at initial or discarded algorithmic designs as part of the process. 
% \end{itemize}

As a project, \gls{absol} has had a very heavy research bent. 
The experimental nature of the toolchain resulted in a heavy up-front design load and, combined with the highly theoretical nature of the language verification algorithms, this meant that design and algorithmic development dominated the time spent on the project.\\

This section aims to illustrate the significant design work that was put into all facets of the project.
It starts with a high-level overview of the architecture of the toolchain, showing the main system components and tying them to the overarching system requirements.
It then explores the design process for the metalanguage, \gls{metaspec}, demonstrating the careful thought that went into the final result.
