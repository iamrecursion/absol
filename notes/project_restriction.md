# Restricting the Project Scope

## Potential Impacts
- Funcall and the other special forms are important for the quality of the project.
- System has to check the preconditions 
- Nice to have an example of a useful language
- An example of a language that could be written in metaspec that would be rejected by the checker. 
- Discuss what would've otherwise been done in 'future' work -> Show that it is still possible, and indicate how the drive in this direction has been influencing the existing portions of the project.
